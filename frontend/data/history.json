These agents are designed to \"take actions in an environment in order to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\" They are the entities that learn how to attain a complex objective by being penalized for wrong decisions and rewarded for right ones, similar to how reinforcement learning algorithms function.\n\n**Key points:**\n*   The term \"agentic\" is not defined or discussed in the provided context.\n*   \"AI agents\" are referred to as \"software agents.\"\n*   Software agents are central to Reinforcement Learning.\n*   Their primary function is to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.\n\n**Examples:**\n*   The context states that \"software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\" This implies that the algorithms described as being \"penalized when they make the wrong decisions and rewarded when they make the right ones\" are the mechanisms through which these software agents learn and operate.",

It focuses on the construction and study of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to learn from data. The primary purpose of machine learning is to allow computers to perform specific tasks or make predictions/decisions without being explicitly programmed. These algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs and then using that model.\n\n**Key Points:**\n*   **Discipline/Subfield:** It is a scientific discipline and a subfield of computer science stemming from artificial intelligence.\n*   **Core Function:** Explores algorithms and statistical models that learn from data.\n*   **Programming Style:** Allows computer systems to perform tasks without explicit programming.\n*   **Process:** Algorithms build a model from example inputs, which is then used for predictions or decisions.\n*   **Purpose:** To learn from data and learn patterns from training data.\n*   **Ties:** Has strong ties to statistics and mathematical optimization.\n\n**Examples:**\n*   Web search engines like Google, where machine learning is applied every time a search is performed.\n\n### Deep Learning\n\n**Main Explanation:**\nDeep learning is an extension of artificial neural networks. It involves constructing much deeper and more complex neural networks compared to traditional artificial neural networks. These deep learning networks are characterized by being built of multiple layers of interconnected artificial neurons and form a class of pattern matching algorithms.\n\n**Key Points:**\n*   **Origin/Extension:** Extends from artificial neural networks.\n*   **Structure:** Involves building much deeper and more complex neural networks.\n*   **Composition:** Networks are built of multiple layers of interconnected artificial neurons.\n*   **Type of Algorithm:** Forms a class of pattern matching algorithms.\n*   **Purpose:** Often used to mimic human brain processes, particularly in response to light, sound, and vision.\n\n**Examples:**\nThe context describes deep learning's application in mimicking human brain processes in response to light, sound, and vision, but does not provide specific real-world examples beyond this general description.",

It stems from research in artificial intelligence.\n*   **Core Function:** It gives computers the ability to learn from data and perform tasks without explicit programming.\n*   **Mechanism:** It relies on algorithms and statistical models that build a model from example inputs (training data) to make predictions, decisions, or learn patterns.\n*   **Purpose:** To learn from data, teach machines to handle data more efficiently, and extract relevant information from abundant datasets, particularly when direct human interpretation is challenging.\n*   **Demand:** The demand for machine learning is rising due to the vast availability of datasets, leading many industries to apply it for data extraction.\n\n### Examples\n\n*   A web search engine like Google, which uses learning algorithms daily.",

However, the concept of \"software agents\" is explained within the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning.\n\n### Main explanation\nWhile the specific term \"agentic AI\" is not explicitly defined, the context describes \"software agents\" as a core component of **Reinforcement Learning**. These software agents are concerned with how they \"ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\" This implies that agentic AI, based on this context, refers to AI systems designed as agents that interact with an environment, making decisions and taking actions with the goal of achieving a specific objective, typically maximizing a reward over time.\n\n### Key points\n*   It is closely associated with **Reinforcement Learning**, which is one of the three basic machine learning paradigms (alongside supervised and unsupervised learning).\n*   It involves **software agents** that operate within an environment.\n*   These agents are designed to **take actions** within that environment.\n*   The primary goal of these agents is to **maximize some notion of cumulative reward**.\n\n### Examples\nThe provided context does not offer specific examples of \"agentic AI\" or the types of actions these software agents might take, beyond their general function within Reinforcement Learning.",
